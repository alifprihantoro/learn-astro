<p>Hello, I’m Alief Prihantoro, a Front-End Web Developer from Indonesia. I specialize in accessibility, performance, and SEO, and I also have a working knowledge of back-end development, UI/UX design, and CI/CD. I’m fluent in Bahasa Indonesia and have a good command of English.</p>
<p>As a developer, I take pride in writing clean, well-organized code that is optimized for performance and cost-effectiveness. I believe that accessibility is a fundamental aspect of web development, and I always strive to make my websites as inclusive as possible.</p>
<p>Aside from my work as a developer, I’m also the founder of Muryp, an open-source organization aimed at making web development easier for developers of all skill levels. Through Muryp, I offer tutorials, articles, and open-source projects to help developers improve their skills and build better websites and applications.</p>
<p>Currently, I’m a freelance developer, but I’m also open to project collaborations and hire work in a company. I’m open to working on projects for competitions or even internships in a company to gain more experience and learn from other developers.</p>
<p>Thank you for taking the time to learn more about me, and feel free to get in touch if you’re interested in working together on a project or just want to connect.</p>
